# portfolio

This is a straightforward, simple website desiged to both showcase projects and provide a means to contact the developer. Each page display a header, page specific content, and a footer.

The index.html page displays a photograph relevant to the theme of "ElectricGoon." The portfolio.html page currently only displays the message "Check Back Soon." On the services.html page, a questionnaire button will display a survey the user can fill out and submit in order to request work from the developer. Finally, the contact.html page contains a general contact form. 

The navigation bar will convert into a drop down menu when a page is less than 700 pixels. A jQuery function creates the toggle effect. I originally attempted to use a hover effect in CSS. However, this created a "sticky hover" in mobile formats, so I decided to use jQuery instead. 

The the survey on the services.html page utilizes jQuery again in order to access the survey when the "Questionnaire" button is clicked. 

Finally, the contact page uses vanilla javascript to give functionality to the submit button. I built it before I reached the jQuery tutorials in Treehouse or else I would have probably used jQuery again. 

That's it. That's my first website. Thanks to Brian and all of the Code Louisville staff and mentors for helping me get here.
